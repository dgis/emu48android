DESCRIPTION

This project ports the Windows application Emu48 written in C to Android.
It uses the Android NDK. The former Emu48 source code (written by Sébastien Carlier and Christoph Giesselink) remains untouched because of a thin win32 emulation layer above Linux/NDK!
This win32 layer will allow to easily update from the original Emu48 source code.
It can open or save the exact same state files (state.e48/e49) than the original Windows application!

Some KML files with theirs faceplates are embedded in the application but it is still possible to open a KML file and its dependencies by selecting a folder.

The application does not request any permission (because it opens the files or the KML folders using the content:// scheme).

The application is distributed with the same license under GPL and you can find the source code here:
https://github.com/dgis/emu48android


QUICK START

1. From the left side, slide your finger to open the menu.
2. Touch the "New..." menu item.
3. Select a default calculator (or "[Select a Custom KML script folder...]" where you have copied the KML scripts and ROM files (Android 11 may not be able to use the Download folder)).
4. And the calculator should now be opened.


NOTES

- The Help menu displays Emu48's original help HTML page and may not accurately reflect the behavior of this Android version.
- When using a custom KML script by selecting a folder, you must take care of the case sensitivity of its dependency files.
- Starting with the version 1.4, a RAM card generator for the port 2 of the HP48SX and HP48GX has been added.
  Like with the MKSHARED.EXE on Windows, you can generate the card in a file (i.e.: SHARED.BIN).
  And then, to use with the HP48SX or the HP48GX, you must select this generated file in the "Settings/Port2 File".
- By default when you create a new HP49/50 with the embedded readonly file "rom.49g",
  everything that you store in port 2 is lost just because the file "rom.49g" is READONLY.
  Since version 2.0, it is now possible from the menu to manage the Flash ROM file (it will fully replaces the ROM).
- To speed up printing, set the 'delay' to 0 in the calculator's print options.
- The serial ports, wire or infrared (infrared limited to 2400 baud) can now be used through the USB port in mode OTG.
  It uses the library https://github.com/mik3y/usb-serial-for-android, which allows to plug most of the serial USB adapters (only tested with Prolific and Ch34x),
  without the need to be root. If it is not automatic, please, activate the OTG mode in your Android device, and then,
  you should be able to see it in the Emu48 settings.
  It is still experimental and I see some issues when sending characters from the emulator to a real HP48 or HP49 with the kermit protocol.
  The communication can be artificially slowed down in this direction using an option.
  If the adapter is unplugged then plugged back in, you may need to call OPENIO/CLOSEIO.
