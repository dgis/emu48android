This project ports the Windows application Emu48 written in C to Android.
It uses the Android NDK. The former Emu48 source code (written by SÃ©bastien Carlier and Christoph Giesselink) remains untouched because of a thin win32 emulation layer above Linux/NDK!
This win32 layer will allow to easily update from the original Emu48 source code.
It can open or save the exact same state files (state.e48/e49) than the original Windows application!

Some KML files with theirs faceplates are embedded in the application but it is still possible to open a KML file and its dependencies by selecting a folder.

The application does not request any permission (because it opens the files or the KML folders using the content:// scheme).

The application is distributed with the same license under GPL and you can find the source code here:
